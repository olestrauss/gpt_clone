# GPT Clone Project

## Description

This site uses OpenAI's API and its GPT-3.5-Turbo model. It is in no way its own LLM, rather just a wrapper meant to practice web development.
The backend uses JS for web functions, and Pythons flask framework.

Persistent memory through SQL database implementation. Remembers past conversations even if app is closed.

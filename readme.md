# GPT Clone Project

## Description

This site uses OpenAI's API and its GPT-3.5-Turbo model. It is in no way its own LLM, rather just a wrapper meant to practice web development.
The backend uses JS for web functions, and Pythons flask framework.

## Technologies Used

- dotenv
- openAPI
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- JS

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/olestrauss/gpt_clone.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd gpt-clone`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Also ensure to have your own OpenAPI key in your env (or `.env` file)

To use, either run `main.py` in your IDE of choice, or navigate to the dir, and run `python main.py`.

## TODO 

Styling has to be improved (or rather, has to be started).
